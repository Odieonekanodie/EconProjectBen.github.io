       <h2>Argument:</h2>
       <h2>
            <b>Through raiding, Russia hoped to gain better trade.</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Russia initially invaded Ukraine in 2014 to secure the port of Sevastapol. 
            The combination of a lack of meaningful international condemnation and the 
            overall hostility that the Ukrainian government had towards Russia only encouraged the 
            Russian government to launch a full scale invasion in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was likely due to the desire to replace the current Ukrainian government with a 
            friendly one, which would allow Russia to regain the influence it lost in the country 
            back in 2014. Hence the header.

        <h1>Part 2: Hard Power Versus Soft Power</h1>
        <img src = "https://static.dw.com/image/17303004_604.jpg"
        style = width:50%>

        <h2>
            There are two primary ways to describe a country's influence: Hard Power and Soft Power.
        </h2>
        <li><b>Hard Power: </b>The usage of coersion to influence others. This is primarily done through the use of military and economic means.</li>
        <p>
            Military alliances, like the CSTO, are an example of Hard Power. Not only do military alliances put greater emphasis on its stronger members,
            but they are also often economically linked with each other. While the CSTO has weakened over the years, the member states are still
            very dependent on Russia economically and militarily<sup>[3][4]</sup>.
        </p>
        <li><b>Soft Power: </b>Non coersive influence of others. This can be done through ideology, culture, and more.</li>
        <p>
            Russia has a sizeable amount of soft power, particularly through its influence of other countries' politics.
            As for Ukraine, one big example of the usage of soft power is the promotion of the Russian Orthodox Church,
            which is under the Patriarch of Moscow, Kirill, who is a close ally of Putin<sup>[5]</sup>.

        style = width:50%>
        <h2>Lets take a moment and examine the West, more specifically the EU.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Russia has long been supplying the EU with its energy needs.</li>
            <li>This was particularly the case with natural gas.</li>
            <li>Russian supply of natural gas to Europe saw an overall gradual increase.</li>
            <li>Supplied 32% of natual gas to the EU as of 2021<sup>[6][7][8]</sup>.</li>
        </ul>

        Style = width:80%>

        <h2>Economic Interdependence</h2>
        <p>	
            Supply of natural gas and various other resources by Russia to the European Union, 
            as well as European supply of goods to Russia, which will not be focused on here, 
            created a large amount of economic interdependence between Russia and the EU.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helped increase Russia's influence in the region.</li>
            <li>Reliance on gas made it more difficult for dependent countries to go against Russia's interests.</li>
            <li>Angela Merkel's opposition to further sanctions against Russia in 2017 is an example of this<sup>[9]</sup>.</li>
            <li>Economic sanctions did hit Russia after the annexation.</li>
            <li>While they were harmful, the EU still remained dependent on Russian exports<sup>[10]</sup>.</li>

            <li>Led to ousting of another Pro-Russian government.</li>
            <li>Was the tipping point that led to the anexation of Crimea.</li>
            <li>Russia invaded to secure the Sevastapol Port and to weaken Ukraine<sup>[12]</sup>.</li>
            <li>Russia would also support separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With a weakened Ukraine, Russia hoped to rexert its influence over the region and prevent Ukraine's
            entry into NATO, which would be a massive strategic loss for Russia.

        <h2>Why 2014 and not 2004?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Russia was in a much weaker economic state.</li>
            <li>Most recent conflicts were two disasterous invasions of Chechnya.</li>
            <li>Russia was still attempting to ally with the west.</li>
            <li>2014 Russia was simply more powerful than 2004 Russia<sup>[13]</sup>.</li>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Heya! I'm Ben! I've only been using programming and markup languages for a little bit,
            but I'm working to improve at it every day. This project was actually pretty fun to do.
            It was my first real experience with HTML and CSS, but it really helped me get a better
            understanding of how these things, along with Javascript, work together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I primarily focus on Java, but it's pretty cool to test other things out as well. And hey, even 
            though this website really basic, it's still something that I can put on my resume 
            as a project that I've worked on. Every little bit helps!
        </p>
        <h2>Why did I make a website about this topic?</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to go with this topic for a multitude of reasons, one of the biggest of these being that 
            I have been keeping up with the Russo-Ukrainian War since it began. I have already done presentations about this war,
            but I have never done one about the potential economic reasons for why Russia may have chosen to invade. This idea
            partially came from one of the questions that was in the midterm exam, and it was a question that I wanted to go
            into much more detail about than I was able to. I love time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to try using Html, CSS, and Javascript more, since these are languages that I
            want to get more experience with. This obviously will not look as good as a powerpoint, but that is not really the point.
            This is a good learning experience for me, and it gives me a project where I can actually test out these skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been rambling on for long enough, so I'll just link this little video that helps explain the development process
            of this. Just click the image below. Have a good one ^^
